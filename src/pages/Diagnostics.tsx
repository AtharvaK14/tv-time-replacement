 *
 * - Haven't Yet Started: zero watch activity ever.
 * - (else, has activity) no next unseen episode -> null (caught up /
 *   finished; rewatches never resurface it).
 * - (else) next unseen episode exists -> Watch Next if last PROGRESSION is
 *   within the threshold, otherwise Haven't Watched For a While. The split
 *   uses progression (max watchedAt = last time an unseen episode was
 *   first-watched), NOT last activity, so a rewatch can't drag a stalled
 *   show back into Watch Next.
