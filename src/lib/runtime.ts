/**
 * TMDB's episode_run_time is an array (sometimes with multiple values for
 * shows with varying episode lengths, sometimes empty for shows lacking the
 * data, confirmed directly from TMDB's own staff on their forum: they do not
 * track true per-episode runtime, this field is a show-level average, and it
 * can be empty). Average what's there.
 *
 * FALLBACK_RUNTIME_MINUTES is used only when TMDB has nothing at all for a
 * show. This is a judgment call, not a TMDB-confirmed number, there is no
 * "correct" universal answer since actual runtimes vary from ~22 (sitcoms)
 * to ~60+ (dramas) minutes. 40 is a rough middle estimate. This existing
 * specifically so an affected show contributes SOMETHING to your total
 * rather than silently zero forever, which was the actual bug: previously
 * a missing value was cached as null and never retried, permanently
 * excluding that show from your stats with no way to self-correct.
