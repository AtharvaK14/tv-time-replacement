/**
 * Single write path for episode watch events (rewatch support). Two
 * distinct operations with deliberately different semantics:
 *
 * - ensureEpisodesWatched: idempotent "make these count as watched". Rows
 *   that already exist are left completely untouched — re-running "mark
 *   season watched" must never reset an imported watchCount back to 1
 *   (the old bulkPut-with-watchCount:1 did exactly that, silently wiping
 *   rewatch history for episodes that were already watched).
 * - recordRewatch: adds one more watch EVENT to rows: watchCount + 1 and
 *   lastWatchedAt = now, never a duplicate row, so time-watched stats grow
 *   while distinct-episodes-watched stays stable.
 *
 * Both bump Show.lastWatchedAt = "last activity of ANY kind" (used by
 * Library's "Recently watched" sort). This is deliberately NOT what the
 * Watch Next / "Haven't Watched For a While" split keys off — that uses
 * last PROGRESSION (lastProgressionAt below), so rewatching old episodes
 * updates history/time/recency without faking forward progress.

 * The most recent time the user watched a previously-UNSEEN episode, i.e.

 * date and is never touched by a rewatch (rewatches only bump watchCount +
 * lastWatchedAt), so max(watchedAt) across a show's rows is exactly "when
 * did they last advance the series". Null when nothing has been watched.
 *
 * This is the signal the Home category split must use: rewatching S1E1..
 * S2E2 of a stalled show leaves every watchedAt untouched, so the show
 * stays in "Haven't Watched For a While" until S2E3 (a new episode) is
 * actually watched.
